# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview:

#### Pewlett-Hackard has asked us to determine how many people are eligible for retirement and among other things what departments they are from and what titles do they hold. Pewlett-Hackard is a well-established company that has been around a long time and they fear that they will be caught off guard by how many people might be retiring soon. In addition, we were asked to determine how many people could qualify for a mentorship program that they are establishing to help ease the transition of new employees. We will use entity relationship diagrams created in QuickDBD as well as PgAdmin 4 to run all our SQL queries.

## Results:

#### While our analysis required many steps, one of the first results was the number of people eligible to retire. According to the data compiled, over 90,000 individuals can retire in the next five years. This represents an enormous number of the total number of employees currently working at Pewlett-Hackard. The screenshot below shows the numbers and job titles of those eligible to retire.

## Senior Engineers and Senior Staff

#### What is most concerning about the data is that many of the employees eligible to retire come from Senior positions. Almost two-thirds of those about to retire are either Senior Engineers or Senior staff. Not only will Pewlett-Hackard be short of employees, but they will also be short of those that contain institutional knowledge.  

## Departments Most Affected

#### Another area of concern for Pewlett-Hackard is that over half of the eligible retires come from three departments. The Development, Production, and Sales departments are going to lose nearly 53,000 employees as shown in the screenshot below.

## Mentorship Program

#### In order to determine the employees eligible for the mentorship program we needed to isolate those that were born in 1965. The results show that approximately 1549 individuals qualify as shown in the snapshot below. It must be recalled that over 90,000 individuals are eligible to retire in the next four years from Pewlett-Hackard and 1549 potential mentors will be insufficient to help slow the dramatic institutional knowledge loss.

## Conclusions

#### The biggest take away from the Pewlett-Hackard analysis is that most of the institutional knowledge within the company will be retiring in the next four years. Over 90,000 employees or a third of workforce is eligible to retire. Future Human Resource projections need to be more proactive in their data collection and analysis in order to prevent this type of scenario again.

#### However not all hope is lost. While the number of mentors is not what Pewlett-Hackard was probably expecting, one area that will help ease the pain is the that those that are eligible for the program make up the most critical areas of the company. As shown below, Senior Staff, Engineers, and Senior Engineers have the largest numbers.

#### Another silver lining is the fact that Pewlett-Hackard can increase the eligibility pool of the mentorship program. By allowing those that have retired in the past five years the opportunity to participate, they may have the numbers they need to build a successful program.

#### Finally, one aspect of the analysis identified a gender gap in the number of employees. As shown below, Pewhett-Hackard is male dominated and because of this information the company could create more opportunities in computer science for female employees.
